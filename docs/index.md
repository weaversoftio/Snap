## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

SNAP consists of several key components:

- **SnapAPI**: FastAPI-based backend service with REST API endpoints
- **SnapUI**: React-based web interface for management and monitoring
- **SnapWatcher**: Operator that runs inside SnapAPI for container monitoring
- **SnapHook**: Webhook system for automation and event-driven operations
- **Cluster Monitor DaemonSet**: User-deployed component for cluster monitoring

## üìñ Use Cases

### Disaster Recovery
- Instant application state backup and recovery
- Cross-region disaster recovery with minimal RTO/RPO
- Application state preservation during infrastructure failures

### Application Migration
- Seamless migration between Openshift clusters
- Legacy application containerization with state preservation
- Blue-green deployments with instant rollback capabilities

### Development & Testing
- Development environment state capture and sharing
- Testing with real production-like states
- Rapid environment provisioning and teardown
